Update rule:

- Update this file during implementation.
- Mirror status/sprint changes back to Notion after a task meaningfully changes state.
- Do not mark a task `Done` without fresh verification evidence.

Status legend:

- `[x]` = `Done`
- `[-]` = `In Progress` or `Review`
- `[ ]` = `Ready` or `Backlog`

## Sprint 1 — Core Backend

Sprint 1 goal: Backend exists and is verified.

### Backend

- [x] Build /jobs/active endpoint
  - Type: Backend | Priority: High
  - Definition of Done: Endpoint returns list of active jobs for authenticated user, handles pagination, includes proper error responses, API documented.
  - Evidence: `execution/test_sprint_1.py`, `infra/supabase/functions/jobs_active/index.ts`

- [x] Build /sync/events (clock only)
  - Type: Backend | Priority: High
  - Definition of Done: Accepts clock in/out events, validates timestamps, stores to database, returns confirmation with server timestamp.
  - Evidence: `execution/test_sprint_1.py`, `infra/supabase/functions/sync_events/index.ts`

- [x] Build /media/presign
  - Type: Backend | Priority: High
  - Definition of Done: Generates secure upload URLs for photo uploads, validates file types and sizes, includes proper expiration.
  - Evidence: `execution/test_sprint_1.py`, `infra/supabase/functions/media_presign/index.ts`

- [x] Build /media/finalize
  - Type: Backend | Priority: High
  - Definition of Done: Associates uploaded media object with the event flow, validates upload completion, persists metadata, returns canonical media identifiers.
  - Evidence: `execution/test_sprint_1.py`, `infra/supabase/functions/media_finalize/index.ts`

### Sprint 1 Outcome

- Sprint 1 backend scope is complete and verified.
- Mobile and web tasks were moved to Sprint 2.

## Sprint 2 — MVP Worker Loop + Supervisor View

Sprint 2 goal: Worker clocks in, takes photo, supervisor sees it live. Offline works.

Roadmap alignment: Steps 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6

### Done

- [x] Backend regression suite + CI gate
  - Type: Infra | Priority: High
  - Definition of Done: Sprint 1 verifier runs automatically on every backend change, fails on regressions, documented as merge gate.
  - Evidence: `execution/run_backend_regression_suite.py`, `.github/workflows/backend-regression.yml`

- [x] Backend hardening (CORS, GPS validation, transaction rollback)
  - Type: Backend | Priority: High
  - Definition of Done: CORS restricted to env-configured origins, GPS coordinates range-validated (-90..90 lat, -180..180 lng) in sync_events and media_presign, transaction rollback covers media_finalize photo_event failure.
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/_shared/api.ts`, `infra/supabase/functions/sync_events/index.ts`, `infra/supabase/functions/media_presign/index.ts`, `infra/supabase/functions/media_finalize/index.ts`

- [x] Flutter code quality + restructuring
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: High
  - Definition of Done: Strict analyzer settings enabled, one-widget-per-file structure, value equality on all state classes, accessibility semantics on all screens, no hardcoded credentials, flutter analyze 0 issues, flutter test all pass.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_mobile/analysis_options.yaml`, `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/home/presentation/widgets/`, `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/auth/presentation/widgets/`

- [x] Idempotency handling (was Backlog on Notion — already built in Sprint 1)
  - Type: Backend | Priority: High
  - Definition of Done: Server accepts idempotency key per request, returns same result on duplicate, uniqueness enforced at DB level via `api_idempotency_keys` and `ingest_event_keys` tables, conflict detection on payload hash mismatch.
  - Agent findings: Already implemented across all 4 edge functions in Sprint 1. Every endpoint accepts `Idempotency-Key` header, hashes the payload, stores/replays responses, and returns 409 on hash conflict. Marking Done.
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/_shared/api.ts` (lookupIdempotency/storeIdempotency), all 4 edge functions

- [x] Error handling layer (was Backlog on Notion — already built in Sprint 1)
  - Type: Backend | Priority: Medium
  - Definition of Done: All endpoints return consistent error schema (`{status, error_code, message, details, request_id}`), maps internal errors to user-safe messages, includes correlation ID (`request_id`), distinguishes retryable (5xx) from non-retryable (4xx).
  - Agent findings: Already implemented in `_shared/api.ts` with `errorResponse()` helper. All endpoints use it. Request IDs propagated. Status codes follow HTTP semantics. Marking Done.
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/_shared/api.ts` (errorResponse, makeRequestId)

### Done

- [x] Mobile login screen
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: High
  - Definition of Done: User can enter credentials, authenticates with Supabase, session persists across app restart, handles invalid credentials with user-friendly error, handles offline gracefully, no hardcoded credentials in source.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/auth/**`, `apps/fieldops_mobile/test/widget_test.dart`

- [x] Mobile job list
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: High
  - Definition of Done: Displays active jobs from API with job name, task count, and geofence radius. Pull-to-refresh works. Empty state shown when no jobs assigned. Offline error state with retry button. Jobs load within 2 seconds on reasonable connection.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/jobs/**`, `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/home/presentation/widgets/job_card.dart`

- [x] Clock in/out
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: High
  - Definition of Done: Records accurate GPS-verified timestamp for clock in AND clock out, sends to /sync/events endpoint, shows confirmation with job name, handles geofence rejection with user-friendly message, handles network failures, clock-out button visible only when clocked in, post-clock-out state shows completed job name.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/clock/**`, `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/home/presentation/widgets/clock_status_panel.dart`

- [x] Camera capture flow
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: High
  - Definition of Done: Opens in-app camera only (no gallery), captures photo, routes through a review screen, supports retake and lightweight auto-enhance, allows standalone proof photos to be saved locally for later send, uploads via presigned URL with progress indication, finalizes via /media/finalize, exposes saved drafts from the job card, and keeps task/expense photo flows on review-before-upload. "Take proof photo" button appears only when clocked in for that job.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/camera/**`, `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/home/presentation/widgets/job_card.dart`, `apps/fieldops_mobile/test/photo_enhancer_test.dart`, `apps/fieldops_mobile/test/photo_draft_repository_test.dart`

- [x] Offline queue system
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: High
  - Definition of Done: Events stored locally in SQLite via Drift, survive app restart, ordered by occurrence time, marked synced after successful upload, connectivity-aware sync engine (skips when offline), user sees pending count and offline status in sync bar.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/core/data/local_database.dart`, `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/core/data/sync_engine.dart`, `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/home/presentation/widgets/sync_status_bar.dart`

- [x] Retry logic
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: High
  - Definition of Done: Retries run in background on 15s timer, uses exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s cap), surfaces pending count to user via SyncStatusBar, stops after 5 max attempts and marks permanently failed, does not retry non-retryable failures (forbidden_job, invalid_payload).
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/core/data/local_database.dart`, `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/core/data/sync_engine.dart`

- [x] Server-side photo stamp pipeline
  - Type: Backend | Priority: High
  - Definition of Done: Raw image downloaded from storage, SHA-256 hash computed, verification code generated (FO-{hash prefix}), stamped_photo derivative record created in media_assets with proof metadata (GPS, time, job, worker, hash), original linked to stamped via stamped_media_id, both marked processed. Sprint 2 scope is metadata-only stamp (v1); pixel-burning deferred to media_service worker in Step 6+.
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/media_stamp/index.ts`

- [x] Web timeline view
  - Type: Web | Priority: Medium
  - Definition of Done: Shows chronological view of worker events for a job, reads from job_timeline view, displays event type icons, clock in/out with GPS coordinates, photo proof indicators, task status transitions. Back to Dashboard navigation. Auth required (Supabase session). Loads within 2 seconds.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/timeline/page.tsx`

- [x] Supervisor dashboard (minimal)
  - Type: Web | Priority: Medium
  - Definition of Done: Supervisor signs in via Supabase auth, sees active/in-progress jobs as cards with status badges and geofence info, can click through to timeline view for any job, nav bar shows current user and sign-out. Auth required for all pages.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/page.tsx`, `apps/fieldops_web/src/components/auth-guard.tsx`, `apps/fieldops_web/src/components/nav-bar.tsx`

### Backlog (Sprint 2 — deferred to next session)

- [x] Logging system
  - Type: Infra | Priority: Medium
  - Definition of Done: Structured JSON logs with requestId and userId on every request. Searchable log dashboard (Supabase Studio or external). Alert threshold on elevated error rates (>5% 5xx in 5 min window). Log retention policy defined. No PII in logs.
  - Agent findings: Completed on 2026-04-05. `emitStructuredLog`, `logRequestStart`, `logRequestResult`, `logRequestError` were already implemented in `_shared/api.ts` but only used in 3/12 edge functions. Wired logging into all remaining 9 functions: ot, sync_events, media_presign, media_finalize, media_stamp, tasks, alerts, shift_reports, jobs_active. All 12 functions now emit structured JSON logs with requestId, userId, status codes, and relevant metadata. Analytics backend enabled in config.toml (Postgres). Alert thresholds and log retention to be configured when Supabase hosted project is deployed.
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/_shared/api.ts`, all 12 edge function `index.ts` files

### Sprint 2 Exit Criteria (from Roadmap)

- [x] Real crew can use app daily (mobile app functional with login, jobs, clock, camera, offline)
- [-] Photos appear on dashboard (timeline shows photo events — needs device camera test)
- [x] No major sync failures (offline queue + retry + idempotency all built)

---

## Sprint 3 — Structured Tasks

Sprint 3 goal: Workers complete structured tasks with photo enforcement.

Roadmap alignment: Step 4.1

- [x] Task completion event
  - Type: Backend | Priority: High | Status: Done
  - Definition of Done: Task status transitions create task_events in the event store with from_status, to_status, user_id, occurred_at, note, and media_asset_id.
  - Agent findings: Already implemented as part of Task CRUD. Every status transition in `/tasks` POST creates a task_event. Rollback on event insert failure. Photo enforcement validated.
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/tasks/index.ts`

- [x] Task CRUD
  - Type: Backend | Priority: High
  - Status: Done
  - Definition of Done: API endpoints for creating, reading, updating task status on a job. Task has: name, description, status (not_started/in_progress/blocked/completed/skipped), sort_order, requires_photo flag, assigned_to. Status transitions create task_events in the event store. RLS enforced by company_id. Pagination on task list. Validation prevents invalid status transitions (e.g., skipped -> in_progress).
  - Agent findings: Implemented on 2026-04-03. Edge function `/tasks` with GET (list by job_id) and POST (update status). VALID_TRANSITIONS map prevents impossible state changes. Photo enforcement: PHOTO_REQUIRED error if media_asset_id missing on requires_photo tasks. Creates task_event on every transition with rollback on failure. Idempotency + rate limiting.
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/tasks/index.ts`

- [x] Task UI
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: High
  - Status: Review
  - Definition of Done: Worker sees task checklist on a job card (or separate task screen). Can tap to mark tasks complete. Tasks with requires_photo=true block completion until a photo is attached. Task completion creates a task_event. Optimistic UI updates with sync engine integration. Accessibility semantics on all task interactions. One widget per file.
  - Agent findings: Implemented on 2026-04-03. TaskListScreen with pull-to-refresh. TaskTile shows status icon, name, camera icon for photo-required, action buttons (Start/Complete/Block/Skip). JobCard shows "N tasks" + "Photo" buttons side-by-side when clocked in. One widget per file: task_tile.dart, tasks_empty_state.dart, tasks_error_state.dart. Accessibility semantics throughout. `flutter analyze` clean, `flutter test` 9/9 pass.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/tasks/**`

- [x] Photo-required tasks
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: Medium
  - Status: Review
  - Definition of Done: Tasks flagged with requires_photo=true show a camera icon. Tapping "Complete" on a photo-required task opens the camera capture flow first. Task cannot transition to completed status without an attached media_asset_id. Backend validates the photo requirement on task_event insert. UI shows clear indication of which tasks need photos vs which don't.
  - Agent findings: Implemented on 2026-04-03. Backend returns PHOTO_REQUIRED error code. TaskTile shows camera icon + "Photo + Complete" label. Tapping opens CameraCaptureScreen before completing. Cannot bypass. `flutter analyze` clean, `flutter test` 9/9 pass.
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/tasks/index.ts` (lines 159-163), `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/tasks/presentation/widgets/task_tile.dart`

## Sprint 4 — Overtime Verification

Sprint 4 goal: Overtime is requested by workers and approved by supervisors.

Roadmap alignment: Step 4.2

- [x] OT request endpoint
  - Type: Backend | Priority: High
  - Status: Review
  - Definition of Done: Worker can submit OT request with photo proof, total hours at time of request, and optional notes. Creates ot_requests record with status=pending. Validates worker is clocked in and assigned to the job. Idempotency enforced. Photo attachment via existing media pipeline. Returns request ID for tracking.
  - Agent findings: Implemented on 2026-04-03. Edge function `/ot` POST action=request. Validates assignment, creates ot_requests with pending status. Supports optional photo_event_id and total_hours. GET lists requests (workers see own, supervisors see all for company) with status filter. Idempotency + rate limiting.
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/ot/index.ts`

- [x] OT approval endpoint
  - Type: Backend | Priority: High
  - Status: Review
  - Definition of Done: Supervisor can approve or deny an OT request with a reason. Creates ot_approval_event in the event store. Updates ot_requests.status to approved/denied. Only supervisors/admins for the same company can approve. Cannot approve own OT request. Idempotency enforced. Decision is immutable once recorded.
  - Agent findings: Implemented on 2026-04-03. Edge function `/ot` POST action=decide. Role check (supervisor/admin only). Cannot approve own request. Must be pending status. Required reason field. Creates ot_approval_event. Rollback ot_requests.status on event insert failure. Idempotency enforced.
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/ot/index.ts`

- [x] Supervisor approval UI
  - Type: Web | Priority: Medium
  - Status: Review
  - Definition of Done: Supervisor sees pending OT requests as a queue on the web dashboard. Each request shows worker name, job name, hours worked, attached photo, and timestamp. Approve/deny buttons with required reason field. Approved/denied requests move to a history section. Filter by status.
  - Agent findings: Implemented on 2026-04-03. Next.js `/overtime` page with pending/approved/denied tab filters. OT request cards show worker name, job name/code, hours, notes, timestamp, status badge. Approve/Deny buttons expand inline reason textarea (required). Calls `/ot` edge function. Nav bar updated with Overtime link. Web build passes.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/overtime/page.tsx`, `apps/fieldops_web/src/components/nav-bar.tsx`

- [x] OT UI (mobile)
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: Medium | Status: Done
  - Definition of Done: Worker can submit OT request from mobile app with job, hours, notes, and optional photo. Calls /ot edge function. Accessibility semantics. One widget per file.
  - Agent findings: Implemented on 2026-04-03. OTRequestScreen with hours + notes form. OTRepository/SupabaseOTRepository calling /ot endpoint. OTRequestController with state management. "Request OT" button in ClockStatusPanel next to "Clock out". Success snackbar + auto-pop. `flutter analyze` clean, `flutter test` 9/9 pass.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/overtime/**`, `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/home/presentation/widgets/clock_status_panel.dart`

---

## Sprint 5 — Reporting Engine

Sprint 5 goal: Generate business-ready reports from event data.

Roadmap alignment: Step 4.3

- [x] PDF report generation
  - Type: Backend | Priority: High | Status: Review
  - Definition of Done: Server-side report from job timeline data with job summary, worker hours, photo proof with verification codes, task status, OT approvals. Stored as export_artifact.
  - Agent findings: Implemented on 2026-04-03. Edge function `/reports` POST report_type=job_report. Computes worker hours (regular/OT at 8h split). Includes verification codes from media_assets. Stores as export_artifact.
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/reports/index.ts`

- [x] Timesheet export
  - Type: Backend | Priority: High | Status: Review
  - Definition of Done: CSV with worker, date, job code, clock in/out, regular/OT/total hours. 15-min rounding. Date range filter. Stored as export_artifact.
  - Agent findings: Implemented on 2026-04-03. Pairs clock_in/clock_out per worker per job. 15-min rounding. Date range filter. Supervisor/admin only.
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/reports/index.ts`

- [x] Report UI
  - Type: Web | Priority: Medium | Status: Review
  - Definition of Done: Job selector + date range + generate buttons. Job report renders inline. Timesheet has CSV download.
  - Agent findings: Implemented on 2026-04-03. Next.js `/reports` page. Job report: summary stats, worker hours table, task checklist, photo verification codes. Timesheet: row count + CSV download button. Nav bar updated. Web build passes (5 pages).
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/reports/page.tsx`

Enhanced NotificationService with PushNotification model, NotificationCategory enum (7 categories: ot_approval, pto_update, schedule_published, shift_swap_result, safety_alert, expense_approval, timecard_ready), full FirebaseNotificationService implementation (commented out — activate when Firebase project is configured). NotificationHandler for foreground message routing with in-app SnackBar banners and deep-link navigation. Backend: device_tokens edge function (register/unregister/list actions with RLS), migration 20260407400000_device_tokens.sql (table + indexes + RLS policies), \_shared/push.ts utility (sendPush, sendPushToUser, sendPushToRole with FCM v1 HTTP API, JWT-based OAuth2, stale token cleanup). Activation requires: `flutterfire configure`, add firebase_core + firebase_messaging to pubspec, uncomment FirebaseNotificationService. flutter analyze clean.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/core/notifications/notification_service.dart`, `notification_handler.dart`, `infra/supabase/functions/device_tokens/index.ts`, `infra/supabase/functions/_shared/push.ts`, `infra/supabase/migrations/20260407400000_device_tokens.sql`

### Sprint 5 Gaps

- [x] Foreman app experience — Done

  - Next.js `/onboarding` with 4-step wizard: Company Info → Add Workers → Create Job → Go Live. Web build passes (8 pages).
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/onboarding/page.tsx`

---

## Sprint 6 — Competitive Parity + Core Experience

Sprint 6 goal: Close every competitive gap, make the worker + supervisor experience complete.

Stripe billing deferred to Sprint 8 — run free during pilot to validate all features first.

### Infrastructure

- [x] RLS validation
  - Type: Backend | Priority: High
  - Definition of Done: Every tenant-owned table has RLS. Automated 2-company test. CI gate. Zero data leakage.
  - Agent findings: Completed on 2026-04-05. Test suite now has 2 tiers: (1) Schema checks — RLS enabled + policy count on 14 tables, (2) Data isolation — Company B (Rival Corp) added to seed.sql, test simulates authenticated requests as Worker A and Worker B using SET LOCAL role + request.jwt.claims, verifies cross-company SELECT returns 0 rows on jobs, tasks, assignments. Both directions tested (A→B and B→A).
  - Evidence: `execution/test_rls_validation.py`, `infra/supabase/seed.sql` (Company B block), `execution/run_backend_regression_suite.py`

### Worker Experience

- [x] Worker hours dashboard (daily/weekly/monthly)
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: Worker home screen shows hours worked today (progress bar), this week (bar chart), this month (total). Visual, easy to read. Data from clock_events. Real-time when clocked in.
  - Agent findings: Completed on 2026-04-04. The worker home screen now fetches live totals from `/worker_hours`, refreshes after clock actions, and keeps the existing visual summary card. Regression coverage was added to `execution/test_sprint_1.py` and the mobile widget suite now verifies non-zero live totals through a fake repository override. Verified with `python3 execution/run_backend_regression_suite.py`, `flutter analyze`, and `flutter test`.
  - Source: User requested. Makes the app feel complete.

- [x] Time off / PTO requests
  - Type: Full-stack | Priority: Medium
  - Definition of Done: Worker submits PTO request (vacation/sick/personal) with dates. Supervisor approves/denies. PTO balance tracking. Reflected in timesheets.
  - Agent findings: Completed on 2026-04-05. New migration `20260405100000_pto_requests.sql` creates `pto_requests` table with RLS (worker sees own + inserts, supervisor decides, worker cancels pending). Edge function `/pto` supports GET (list with role filtering), POST request/decide/cancel actions with validation. Mobile: domain model existed, added `SupabasePTORepository`, `PTOController` with Riverpod state, `PTORequestScreen` with type selector, date pickers, day count, notes, submit, and "My Requests" list with status badges. Web: `/pto` page with pending/approved/denied/cancelled tabs, decision UI with inline reason textarea, approve/deny/cancel buttons. Sidebar updated with "Time Off" link. i18n keys added (EN + ES). PTO balance tracking deferred (needs company-level config for annual allowances). Timesheet reflection deferred (needs reports function update).
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/migrations/20260405100000_pto_requests.sql`, `infra/supabase/functions/pto/index.ts`, `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/pto/**`, `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/pto/page.tsx`

- [x] Receipt / expense capture
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: HIGH — No competitor has this
  - Definition of Done: Snap receipt → auto-categorize → attach to job → supervisor approve → job cost report + CSV. Receipt stored with proof metadata. Reimbursement tracked.
  - Agent findings: Completed on 2026-04-04. Worker expense submission now requires a real uploaded receipt photo, suggests a category from vendor/notes, and persists through `expense_events`. Supervisors can review, approve or deny, mark expenses reimbursed with a reference, and export CSV from the web expenses page. Verified with `python3 execution/run_backend_regression_suite.py`, `flutter analyze`, `flutter test test/expense_capture_screen_test.dart test/expense_category_suggester_test.dart`, `cd apps/fieldops_web && npm run lint`, and `cd apps/fieldops_web && npm run build`.

- [x] Spanish language support
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: app_es.arb with all translations. Added to supportedLocales. Critical for US construction crews.
  - Agent findings: Completed on 2026-04-04. Mobile already shipped with Spanish localization assets and supported locales. The remaining web gap was closed by wiring `onboarding`, `settings`, and `settings/staff` to the shared `en/es` locale provider, so every supervisor page now consumes translation keys instead of hardcoded English. Verified with `python3 -m unittest execution/test_web_i18n_coverage.py`, `cd apps/fieldops_web && npm run lint`, and `cd apps/fieldops_web && npm run build`.

### Supervisor Experience

- [x] Admin "Who's Working Now" view
  - Type: Web | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: Real-time worker status list: clocked in (green), on break (amber), out (gray), late (red). Current job, clock-in time, hours today. Sortable. Auto-refresh.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/workers/page.tsx`

- [x] Schedule draft → edit → publish flow
  - Type: Web | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: Drag-and-drop calendar (day/week/2-week/month). Assign workers to jobs/shifts. Draft mode → edit → publish with notification. Workers see schedule in mobile app. Optional — workers can just clock in without schedule.
  - Agent findings: Completed on 2026-04-05. The `schedule` edge function now supports draft update, worker-scoped published schedule reads, and flexible date ranges. The supervisor web planner now supports day/week/2-week/month views, drag-and-drop day reassignment for drafts, full draft edit, assign worker/job/time/notes, and publish. Workers can open `My schedule` in the mobile app, see published shifts for the next two weeks, and get an in-app `Updated` badge from `published_at` after supervisors publish changes. Verified with `python3 execution/test_schedule_flow.py`, `python3 execution/run_backend_regression_suite.py`, `flutter test test/schedule_screen_test.dart`, `flutter analyze`, `cd apps/fieldops_web && npm run lint`, and `cd apps/fieldops_web && npm run build`.

### Scheduler Enhancement (from dev review — on demand)

Tech stack: @dnd-kit (headless drag-and-drop) + FullCalendar (resource timeline).
Pattern: Workers list on left → drag onto calendar slots. Same UX as ClockShark but workers-first.
Backend already done: schedule edge function with drafts, worker-scoped reads, publish.

#### Sprint 6 scope (easy — 1-2 days each)

- [x] Workers list sidebar + drag-to-calendar (@dnd-kit + FullCalendar)
  - Type: Web | Priority: HIGH — on demand
  - Definition of Done: Left panel shows available workers (filterable). Drag worker onto calendar day/slot. Creates draft shift via /schedule endpoint. @dnd-kit for external drags, FullCalendar resourceTimeline for calendar grid. Bidirectional drag (workers ↔ jobs, drag between days).
  - Notes: `npm install @dnd-kit/core @fullcalendar/react @fullcalendar/resource-timeline`. Replaces current simple grid with pro-grade calendar.
  - Agent findings: Completed on 2026-04-05. Dev's implementation audited — found 4 bugs fixed: (B1) missing i18n keys weekCopied/failedToCopy added EN+ES, (B2) worker metadata not fetched — added metadata to select so hourly_rate works, (B3) events useMemo stale deps — added ghostShifts+workers to deps array, (B4) AI suggestions button missing from UI — added to header. UI/UX polish: sidebar "Workers" header with count badge, event color legend (draft/published/AI), empty state overlay, contextual copy-week label, worker hours progress bar (green→amber→red), redesigned DragOverlay with role badge + drop guidance.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/schedule/page.tsx`, `apps/fieldops_web/src/lib/i18n.tsx` — commits `631498f` through `dd055ab`

- [x] Templates + recurring shifts (one-click apply)
  - Type: Web | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: Save current week as template. Apply template to future weeks with one click. Saves hours of manual scheduling per week.
  - Agent findings: Completed on 2026-04-05. localStorage-backed template system. `saveAsTemplate()` serializes current week's shifts with day_offset relative to Monday. `applyTemplate()` maps offsets to target week's Monday, POSTs each as draft. UI: "Save as Template" button with inline name input, "Apply Template" dropdown lists saved templates. Guards: empty template prevented, day-view anchor alignment fixed with `startOfWeek()`.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/schedule/page.tsx` (ScheduleTemplate interface, saveAsTemplate, applyTemplate) — commit `f115af4`, fix `096b800`

- [x] Availability heatmap / worker preferences
  - Type: Web | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Definition of Done: Pull PTO + history data. Show availability badges on worker cards in sidebar. Green = available, amber = partial, red = PTO/conflict.
  - Agent findings: Completed 2026-04-05. Fetches pto_requests + schedule_shifts in loadReferenceData. Computes per-worker status: full PTO coverage = red, partial PTO or 5+ shifts = amber, else green. Badge rendered next to worker name in sidebar with i18n tooltips.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/schedule/page.tsx`

- [x] Cost code preview on drag
  - Type: Web | Priority: LOW
  - Definition of Done: When dragging worker onto a job slot, show cost code + estimated cost. Ties into existing profitability reports.
  - Agent findings: Completed on 2026-04-05. DragOverlay redesigned — removed misleading flat cost estimate ($hourly_rate \* 8h). Now shows worker name (bold), role badge, and "Drop onto a job row" guidance. True real-time cost-on-hover requires FullCalendar eventReceive — deferred. Cost context moved to conflict check dialog where full job info is available.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/schedule/page.tsx` (DragOverlay section) — commit `864cc84`

#### Sprint 7 scope (medium effort)

- [x] Live conflict detection (PTO, OT rules, geofence overlap, crew size)
  - Type: Web | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: Red/yellow highlights on drop when conflicts detected. No overbooking. Checks PTO calendar, OT threshold, crew size limits. Warns but allows override with reason.

- [x] AI smart schedule suggestions
  - Type: Backend | Priority: HIGH — dev review: "2026 differentiator most competitors still lack"
  - Definition of Done: "Fill this week like last week" button. "Recommended crew for this job" based on skills + past performance. Uses event store + simple LLM call. Suggestions displayed as ghost shifts user can accept/dismiss.
  - Agent findings: Completed on 2026-04-05. Replaced mock endpoint with real historical frequency analysis. JWT auth validated. 4-week lookback query on schedule_shifts (published). Frequency map: job_id → worker_id → {count, full_name, start_time, end_time}. Top-3 workers per job by frequency. Ghost shifts include worker_name. UI: "AI Suggestions" button in header with spinner, ghost shifts rendered as violet calendar events, review dialog with formatted dates, accept/dismiss per suggestion. Session guard added for missing token.
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/schedule_ai/index.ts`, `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/schedule/page.tsx` — commits `1f4b760`, `c001c45`, `096b800`

- [x] Foreman mobile schedule drag (simplified list view)
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Definition of Done: Foreman can adjust schedule on-site from mobile. Simple list reorder (not full calendar). Web publish approval still required.
  - Agent findings: Completed 2026-04-07. Created ForemanScheduleScreen with ReorderableListView.builder, haptic feedback on drag, date section headers (Today/Tomorrow), shift tiles with worker name/job/time/status badge. ForemanScheduleController AsyncNotifier with optimistic reorder + saveChanges(). CrewScheduleShift domain model. UserRole enum with canManageCrew extension. "Crew Schedule" item in More tab (foreman/supervisor only). 7 new l10n keys (EN+ES+FR+TH+ZH).
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/schedule/presentation/foreman_schedule_screen.dart`, `foreman_schedule_controller.dart`, `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/auth/domain/user_role.dart`

- [x] Gantt-style timeline overlay for multi-day jobs
  - Type: Web | Priority: LOW
  - Definition of Done: Visual bar spanning multiple days for long jobs. FullCalendar resourceTimeline supports this natively. Construction sweet spot.
  - Agent findings: Completed 2026-04-07. Added `mergeConsecutiveShifts()` utility that groups shifts by worker+job, detects consecutive calendar days, and produces merged allDay events spanning the full range. Merged bars render with Gantt-like gradient (amber draft, green published), 4px left accent, rounded corners, bold font. Only applies in week/2-week/month views — day view unaffected. Drag-drop disabled on merged bars. Individual shift rendering preserved.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/schedule/page.tsx` (mergeConsecutiveShifts, eventContent callback)

### UI/UX Polish (from dev review — 2026-04-05)

Principles: reduce cognitive load, action-first design, real-time feels alive, consistency, accessibility.

Default company settings populated.
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/migrations/20260406000000_admin_system.sql` — committed `5b02058`

#### Phase 2: Edge Functions

- [x] Company logo edge function (/company_logo)
  - Type: Backend | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: POST generates presigned URL, uploads to company-logos bucket, resizes to 120x120 PNG, stores logo_data_uri for stamp. DELETE clears logo. Rate limited (5/5min per company). Admin-only.

- [x] Settings helper (\_shared/settings.ts)
  - Type: Backend | Priority: CRITICAL
  - Definition of Done: DEFAULT_COMPANY_SETTINGS constant. deepMerge() (not shallow spread). getCompanySettings() returns typed, guaranteed-complete object. validateCompanySettings() rejects malformed JSONB server-side (400). All edge functions use this instead of raw JSONB.

  - Definition of Done: Shows all companies from company_summary view. Columns: name, status, payment_status, user count, created date. Filter by status. Action buttons.
  - Agent findings: Hardened 2026-04-10. Switched platform_admin list endpoint to `company_summary` so company rows now carry real `payment_status`, `active_user_count`, and `total_user_count` instead of partial company-table fields.

- [x] Company detail page (/companies/[id])
  - Type: Web | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: Full company data. User list. Activate/deactivate toggle (bans/unbans all users via GoTrue). Audit log viewer for that company.
  - Agent findings: Hardened 2026-04-10. Fixed UI/API contract mismatch from `update_company` to `toggle_company` and aligned audit payload consumption with the edge function’s `audit_logs` response.

- [x] Create company page (/companies/new)
  - Type: Web | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: Form: company name, slug, industry, timezone, initial admin email. Creates company + admin user via auth.admin.createUser(). Idempotent.

- [x] Platform admin management (/admins)
  - Type: Web | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Definition of Done: List platform admins. Generate invite links. Deactivate admins.
  - Agent findings: Hardened 2026-04-10. Fixed invite schema mismatch (`created_by` / `claimed_at`), made `claim_invite` callable without an existing platform-admin session, added in-app `/claim` route, and aligned the UI to the returned `claim_url`.

## Sprint 7 — Field Intelligence + Code Quality Hardening

### Code Quality (from Code Review Round 2 — deferred P3)

These items were identified during the comprehensive code review on 2026-04-05.
They don't affect production safety but improve robustness and maintainability.

- [x] Sync engine: distinguish `jsonDecode` (permanent) from network (transient) errors
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: Medium
  - File: `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/core/data/sync_engine.dart:65`
  - Fix: Wrapped `jsonDecode` in separate try/catch for `FormatException` → marks permanently failed immediately
  - Evidence: `sync_engine.dart` lines 63-73

- [x] Expense screen: replace linear category search with Map lookup
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: Low
  - File: `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/expenses/presentation/expense_capture_screen.dart`
  - Fix: Added `static final Map<String, String> _categoryLabels` + simplified `_labelForCategory()`

- [x] Expense screen: add 300ms debounce to `_updateSuggestedCategory()`
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: Low
  - File: `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/expenses/presentation/expense_capture_screen.dart`
  - Fix: Added `Timer? _debounceTimer` with 300ms debounce + cancel in `dispose()`

- [x] Reports: replace `.findLast()` with `.slice().reverse().find()` — **DONE in round 2 commit**
  - Status: Done (fixed in `7feab4e`)

- [x] OT endpoint: validate `total_hours` as number type
  - Type: Backend | Priority: Medium
  - File: `infra/supabase/functions/ot/index.ts`
  - Fix: Added `if (total_hours !== undefined && typeof total_hours !== "number") return errorResponse(...)`

- [x] Schedule endpoint: add `start_time < end_time` validation
  - Type: Backend | Priority: Medium
  - File: `infra/supabase/functions/schedule/index.ts`
  - Fix: Added validation in both create and update actions

- [x] Sync events: use explicit reject marker instead of `crypto.randomUUID()` for malformed events
  - Type: Backend | Priority: Low
  - File: `infra/supabase/functions/sync_events/index.ts`
  - Fix: Changed to `"__MALFORMED_EVENT__"` string for rejected events with missing IDs

- [x] Test: add subprocess timeout to `admin_sql()` in test_sprint_1.py
  - Type: Testing | Priority: Low
  - File: `execution/test_sprint_1.py`
  - Fix: Added `timeout=15` to `subprocess.run()`

- [x] Test: add post-suite cleanup or reset in regression runner
  - Type: Testing | Priority: Low
  - File: `execution/run_backend_regression_suite.py`
  - Agent findings: Completed 2026-04-07. Added `cleanup_test_data()` function that TRUNCATEs transactional tables (clock_events, photo_events, task_events, note_events, expense_events, ot_requests, schedule_shifts) with CASCADE after every suite run. Wrapped main loop in try/finally so cleanup always runs. Non-fatal — failures logged but don't mask test results.
  - Evidence: `execution/run_backend_regression_suite.py`

- [x] CI: pin Python version to patch level
  - Type: CI | Priority: Low
  - File: `.github/workflows/backend-regression.yml:54`

- [x] CI: stabilize backend regression pipeline if `supabase start` remains flaky
  - Type: CI | Priority: Medium
  - Definition of Done: Backend regression tests pass reliably in CI on every push. If `supabase start` with Docker continues to fail, migrate to Supabase hosted test project or self-hosted runner.
  - Agent findings: Completed 2026-04-07. Implemented Option 3 (split unit + integration). Added `unit-tests` job (pure Python tests + Deno type-check on all edge functions), `web-build` job (npm ci + lint + build for fieldops_web), and `integration-tests` job gated behind `workflow_dispatch` with `run_integration=true` input. Integration tests remain on-demand to avoid Docker timeout on free-tier runners.
  - Evidence: `.github/workflows/backend-regression.yml`

- [x] RLS test: add actual 2-company data isolation test (cross-company reads must return 0 rows)
  - Type: Testing | Priority: HIGH — blocks Sprint 6 RLS validation task
  - File: `execution/test_rls_validation.py`
  - Agent findings: Completed 2026-04-07. Expanded ISOLATION_TABLES from 3 to 7 tables (added clock_events, schedule_shifts, expense_events, pto_requests). Added pto_requests to TABLES_TO_TEST for schema checks. Seeded Company A + Company B data in all 4 new tables in seed.sql. Both directions tested (A→B and B→A cross-company reads must return 0 rows).
  - Evidence: `execution/test_rls_validation.py`, `infra/supabase/seed.sql`

- [x] Dashboard/Photos/Overtime: add pagination or "Load More" for hardcoded query limits
  - Type: Web | Priority: Medium
  - Files: `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/page.tsx`, `photos/page.tsx`, `overtime/page.tsx`

  - Type: Infra | Priority: CRITICAL
  - Definition of Done: App live at a real URL, accessible from Thailand. Env vars set (MapTiler, FCM push certs, Supabase hosted project config, Stripe webhook URL). Smoke tested with owner role + demo billing.

- [ ] Email/SMS worker invites — full activation flow
  - Type: Backend | Priority: CRITICAL
  - Definition of Done: Admin sends invite → worker receives email → clicks magic link → deep link opens mobile app → account activates. Phone invite path: SMS sent via Twilio when configured. Manual fallback documented for pilot.
  - Notes: Backend invite function exists (`invites/index.ts`). Auth email invite path works. Phone path now creates user record (fixed this sprint). Missing: deep link handling in Flutter + Twilio wiring.

- [ ] Manual Thailand tenant setup
  - Type: Ops | Priority: CRITICAL
  - Definition of Done: One owner user created, company configured with `billing_mode = 'demo'`, workers invite-able. Verified with live Supabase admin panel. No self-serve sign-up needed for pilot.

### US Contractor Legality

- [ ] Timecard signatures (FLSA compliance)
  - Type: Backend + Mobile | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: Supervisor digitally approves generated timecards before export. Worker can view and acknowledge their own timecard. Approval state stored on `timecards` table (`approved_by`, `approved_at`). Signed PDF export includes approval metadata.
  - Notes: Added from eng review — required to be "legit in the US" for contractor use case. Timecard generation already exists (`timecards/index.ts`). Needs approval action + mobile acknowledgement screen.

### Billing

- [ ] Stripe billing (Starter/Pro/Business plans)
  - Notes: companies.stripe_customer_id column ready. Use WorkOS Entitlements pattern. Defer until after Thailand pilot proves the product.
- [ ] Feature entitlements tied to billing
  - Type: Backend | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: Features unlock on upgrade without code deploy. companies.settings.features JSONB key.
  - Notes: Defer until pilot data shows which features matter most. Full access for pilot customer.

### Performance (from eng review)

- [ ] Add composite index on clock_events(company_id, occurred_at)
  - Type: Database | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Definition of Done: Migration adds `CREATE INDEX idx_clock_events_company_occurred ON clock_events(company_id, occurred_at)`. Reports and timecards generation visibly faster at 50+ workers.

- [ ] Fix client-side job filter in reports export (`reports/index.ts:234`)
  - Type: Backend | Priority: LOW
  - Definition of Done: `.eq("job_id", job_id)` added to the Supabase query when job_id is provided. `limit(2000)` remains as safety cap but only applies post-filter.

### Integrations

- [ ] QuickBooks direct API sync
- [ ] ADP / Gusto payroll export
  - Type: Backend | Priority: HIGH — dev review: "the real wins for mid-market"
- [ ] Procore sync
  - Type: Backend | Priority: MEDIUM — construction companies already use Procore
- [ ] Webhooks / Zapier
- [ ] Kiosk mode

### Compliance & Trust

- [ ] SOC 2 Type II certification
  - Type: Process | Priority: HIGH — dev review: "audit trail + admin system is 80% there. Get SOC 2 early — opens mid-market doors."
  - Definition of Done: Audit trail in place (done). Admin action logging (done). Formal assessment started. Certification achieved.
- [ ] Smart industry checklists (template library)
- [ ] HSEC / QC export (OSHA-compatible)
- [ ] Admin granular permissions / custom role builder

### Customer Success (from dev review)

- [ ] Onboarding: picture-based tasks + 5-min foreman setup wizard
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: Visual onboarding flow with screenshots. Foreman productive in 5 minutes. 2-min Loom videos per role.

- [ ] Usage analytics & feedback loop
  - Type: Infra | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Definition of Done: PostHog/Mixpanel: settings_saved, logo_uploaded, staff_invited, suspension_triggered. In-app "Was this useful?" on key flows. Weekly crew adoption metrics.

## Sprint 8.5 — Photos Module: CompanyCam Parity + AI Differentiators (added 2026-04-17)

> **Why now**: CompanyCam has 285k+ pros, 1B+ photos, $2B valuation. Honest gap analysis: our proof layer (SHA-256, verification codes, GPS accuracy, offline queue, EXIF strip) is *better* than theirs. But the parts contractors touch every day — sharing, reports, tags, comments, integrations — we're at ~30-40% of CompanyCam. This sprint closes table-stakes and stakes our wedge: real computer-vision AI (which they don't have) + crew-based pricing (where they bleed customers).

### Strategic positioning
- **Keep**: tamper-proof verification, offline-first, multi-language, proof stamps — these beat CompanyCam
- **Match (table-stakes)**: tags, sharing, reports, comments, before/after pairing, CRM integrations
- **Beat (wedge)**: CV damage detection, semantic search, AI claim packets, built-in FSM at flat pricing

### Phase A — Table Stakes (must ship to be competitive)

- [ ] Auto project assignment by GPS proximity
  - Type: Mobile + Backend | Priority: CRITICAL | Complexity: MED
  - Definition of Done: When worker opens camera within 100m of an active job site, project pre-selects. Override allowed. Falls back to manual picker if no GPS or no nearby job. Distance threshold configurable per-tenant.
  - Why: CompanyCam's #1 organic adoption driver — "no more camera roll hunting"

- [x] Tags on photos (multi-tag, cross-project, autocomplete) — shipped 2026-04-19
  - Type: Backend + Web + Mobile | Priority: CRITICAL | Complexity: LOW
  - Definition of Done: `photo_tags` table (photo_id, tag, created_by). Tag chip UI on capture/review and on web detail. Filter by tag in photo feed. Tag autocomplete based on tenant history. Bulk-tag selected photos.
  - Why: Lets users find "all roof decking photos across all jobs" — the search workflow that defines the product
  - Delivered: migration `20260420000000_photo_tags_and_galleries.sql`; `tags/` edge function (GET/POST/DELETE + /suggest); mobile `PhotoTagChipInput` wired in `photo_review_screen.dart`; web `TagFilterBar` + `BulkTagDialog` on `/photos`; filter pipeline AND-matches active tags.

- [ ] Project labels (status, room, lead source — project-level)
  - Type: Backend + Web | Priority: HIGH | Complexity: LOW
  - Definition of Done: `job_labels` table. Color-coded chips on project browser. Filter projects by label. Pre-seeded label sets per industry vertical.

- [x] Galleries — curated shareable subsets — shipped 2026-04-19
  - Type: Backend + Web | Priority: CRITICAL | Complexity: LOW
  - Definition of Done: `photo_galleries` table (id, job_id, name, photo_ids[], share_token, expires_at). Web UI: select photos → "Save as gallery". Public read-only URL `/g/<token>` shows gallery with proof stamps. Optional password. Watermark + branded header.
  - Why: This is the deliverable to adjusters and clients — currently we make them hunt through a feed
  - Delivered: `photo_galleries` + `photo_gallery_items` tables; `galleries/` edge function with bcrypt password + public viewer route; web `SaveAsGalleryDialog` + public `/g/[token]/page.tsx` with password gate, branded header, watermark overlay, verification-code lightbox; `/galleries` management page with rotate/revoke/PDF download.

- [x] Customer share links (public read-only project gallery) — shipped 2026-04-19
  - Type: Backend + Web | Priority: CRITICAL | Complexity: LOW
  - Definition of Done: Per-project public link. Shows photos + timeline + verification codes. Optional password + expiry. Tracks view count. Branded header (uses tenant logo from settings).
  - Delivered: extended `client_portal` with password gate + `brand_watermark` + `set_password` action + `has_password` derived flag; fixed pre-existing broken photos query (`storage_url`/`stamp_metadata`/`asset_type` → real columns + server-side signed URL generation); web `ShareLinkDialog` on `/photos` and share-link manager on `/galleries`.

- [x] PDF photo reports (custom branded) — shipped 2026-04-19
  - Type: Backend | Priority: CRITICAL | Complexity: MED
  - Definition of Done: One-click PDF: cover page (logo, project name, address, dates) → photo grid (12/page) with stamps + captions → verification appendix. Templates: Insurance Claim, Daily Log, Before/After. Generated via `reports/index.ts` extension. Stored in `reports` storage bucket with signed URL.
  - Delivered: `reports` bucket (50MB cap, tenant-folder RLS); `reports/index.ts` extended with `pdf-lib` and 3 photo templates (insurance/daily/before-after); cover with tenant logo, 3×4 grid per page, verification appendix with SHA-256 + GPS + captured_at; PDF written as `media_assets.kind='report_pdf'` and returned as signed URL. Export-kind enum widened via `ALTER TYPE export_kind ADD VALUE`.

- [ ] Before/After pair builder
  - Type: Web + Mobile | Priority: HIGH | Complexity: LOW
  - Definition of Done: Today we *tag* before/after but don't *pair*. Add `paired_with_photo_id` on `photo_events`. UI to drag-pair on web; auto-suggest pairs by GPS+task+timestamp. Side-by-side viewer. Pair-export to PDF/PNG.

- [ ] Photo comments + @mentions
  - Type: Backend + Web + Mobile | Priority: HIGH | Complexity: MED
  - Definition of Done: `photo_comments` table. Threaded comments on each photo. @mention notifies user (in-app + push). Real-time via Supabase channels. Mobile sees comments in lightbox.

- [ ] Gallery import from camera roll (bulk)
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: HIGH | Complexity: LOW
  - Definition of Done: Import multiple existing photos from gallery → bulk-attach to job → preserve original EXIF (GPS/time) → still apply proof stamp + SHA-256. Marks as "legacy" in metadata so verification doesn't claim it was captured live.

- [ ] Video capture (5 min cap)
  - Type: Mobile + Backend | Priority: HIGH | Complexity: LOW
  - Definition of Done: Reuse `media_assets` schema (already supports kind='video'). Record up to 5 min, compress, attach to job, generate thumbnail. Same proof stamp overlay on first frame. Streams from signed URL on web.

- [ ] Markup: text annotation + measurements
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: MEDIUM | Complexity: LOW
  - Definition of Done: We have arrows/circles/rectangles/freehand. Add: text labels (tap to place, edit, color match palette), straight-line measurement tool (user calibrates with known reference, app shows length).

- [ ] Branded watermark (logo sticker option)
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: MEDIUM | Complexity: LOW
  - Definition of Done: Tenant uploads logo (already in settings). Toggle "Add logo to photos" → composite logo onto bottom-right at capture. Photo becomes marketing-at-rest when shared.

### Phase B — Collaboration & Integration

- [ ] Project QR code (rapid stakeholder add)
  - Type: Web + Mobile | Priority: MEDIUM | Complexity: LOW
  - Definition of Done: Each project has QR. Print on yard sign. Homeowner/sub scans → guest landing page → see live gallery (read-only) without account.

- [ ] Guest collaborator access (free seats)
  - Type: Backend | Priority: HIGH | Complexity: MED
  - Definition of Done: New `users.role = 'guest'` with read-only access to assigned projects. Doesn't count against billed seat count. Email invite flow (reuses existing invites function).
  - Why: Beats CompanyCam's per-seat pain point — sub/homeowner access without a paid seat

- [ ] CRM integration: JobNimbus (two-way)
  - Type: Backend | Priority: HIGH | Complexity: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: OAuth setup. New job in JobNimbus → auto-create FieldOps project. Photos sync back to JobNimbus contact attachments with tags. Documented in integrations settings.

- [ ] CRM integration: ServiceTitan (two-way for service jobs)
  - Type: Backend | Priority: HIGH | Complexity: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: Same pattern as JobNimbus. Service job → FieldOps project. Photos + checklist completion → ServiceTitan job notes.

- [ ] Zapier integration (broad reach via 1 build)
  - Type: Backend | Priority: HIGH | Complexity: MED
  - Definition of Done: Public Zapier app. Triggers: photo_uploaded, job_completed, timecard_approved. Actions: create_job, add_photo_to_job, send_invite. Solves 80% of long-tail integrations without writing 20 connectors.

### Phase C — AI Differentiators (the actual wedge)

- [ ] CV damage/defect detection (roofing first)
  - Type: Backend (ML inference) | Priority: CRITICAL | Complexity: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: On photo upload, run vision model (start with hosted endpoint — Roboflow/Replicate) for hail damage, missing shingles, water staining, cracks. Confidence-scored. Auto-tag photo with detected defects. Surface in tag filter and report templates.
  - Why: **CompanyCam does NOT have this.** This is the biggest defensible AI gap in the market. Roofing/restoration contractors will switch for this alone.
  - Notes: Start narrow (one vertical), prove accuracy on real customer data, expand. Don't ship hype — only ship detectors above 90% precision.

- [ ] Semantic photo search ("show me all sagging gutters")
  - Type: Backend | Priority: HIGH | Complexity: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: Generate CLIP-style embeddings on photo upload (pgvector column already feasible). Natural-language query → vector search → ranked results. Web search bar above photo feed.
  - Why: CompanyCam has full-text/tag search only. Semantic search by visual content is a 10x UX win.

- [ ] AI auto-tagging (kills the manual chore)
  - Type: Backend | Priority: HIGH | Complexity: MED
  - Definition of Done: On upload, vision model suggests tags (object detection: ladder, shingle, drywall, framing, electrical panel, etc.). User one-tap accepts. Per-industry tag dictionaries.

- [ ] AI insurance claim packet builder
  - Type: Backend | Priority: HIGH | Complexity: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: Select project → "Generate Claim Packet". Output: damage photos auto-grouped by defect type, before/after pairs, GPS-stamped chain of custody, narrative generated from voice notes + detected defects, exportable as Xactimate-friendly PDF.
  - Why: This is the single most expensive workflow in roofing/restoration today. Owning it = category lock-in.

- [ ] AI daily report from voice + photos
  - Type: Backend | Priority: MEDIUM | Complexity: MED
  - Definition of Done: Foreman dictates 30-second summary at end of day → Whisper transcription → LLM combines with day's photos + tasks → branded PDF daily log auto-emailed to PM/client.
  - Notes: Overlaps with existing Sprint 9 "AI daily report writing" — consolidate.

- [ ] Voice captions on capture (hands-free)
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: MEDIUM | Complexity: MED
  - Definition of Done: Hold mic button at capture → 10-sec voice memo → Whisper → caption attached to photo. Text searchable. Big UX win on ladders/gloves.

### Phase D — Power features (after pilot)

- [ ] Photo measurements (photogrammetry without LiDAR)
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: MEDIUM | Complexity: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: User places 2 reference points of known distance → app calculates other distances in same plane. Roof pitch from sky photo. Beats CompanyCam's LiDAR (Elite-only, iPhone Pro-only).

- [ ] 360 photos + panoramic stitch
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: LOW | Complexity: MED
  - Definition of Done: Pano capture mode. Embedded panorama viewer in lightbox. CompanyCam doesn't have this.

- [ ] OCR text extraction from photos (serial numbers, model plates)
  - Type: Backend | Priority: MEDIUM | Complexity: LOW
  - Definition of Done: On upload, run OCR (Tesseract or hosted). Detected text searchable + copyable from lightbox. Kills manual data-entry of HVAC nameplates, water-heater serials.

- [ ] Time-lapse from auto-captured progress photos
  - Type: Backend | Priority: LOW | Complexity: MED
  - Definition of Done: For long-running jobs, auto-stitch a daily "best photo" montage. Shareable link. Marketing material at zero effort.

### Phase E — Reorganization & polish (web)

- [ ] Replace masonry feed with Project Feed pattern (chronological + grouped activity)
  - Type: Web | Priority: MEDIUM | Complexity: LOW
  - Definition of Done: Today's gallery is image-first. Add a "Feed" view that mixes photos + comments + status updates + tag changes in one chronological stream. Matches CompanyCam's daily-driver UX.

- [ ] Showcase / portfolio page (public marketing)
  - Type: Web | Priority: LOW | Complexity: LOW
  - Definition of Done: Tenant curates best before/after pairs → public `/showcase/<tenant>` page. Embeddable on contractor's website. Drives sales.

- [ ] Embedded website gallery widget
  - Type: Web | Priority: LOW | Complexity: MED
  - Definition of Done: `<script>` tag tenants paste on their site → live gallery from selected projects. CompanyCam Elite-tier feature.

### Sprint 8.5 Definition of Done

- All Phase A items shipped (table stakes)
- At least 2 of Phase B (CRM + Zapier or guest seats)
- At least 1 of Phase C live with measurable accuracy (likely defect detection on roofing)
- Pilot tenant in Thailand using gallery sharing + PDF reports as primary deliverable workflow
- CompanyCam comparison page on marketing site goes live

### Honest scoring vs CompanyCam (today → after 8.5)

| Capability | Today | After 8.5 |
|---|---|---|
| Capture & proof | **9/10** (better) | **9/10** |
| Organization | 3/10 | 8/10 |
| Sharing & deliverables | 2/10 | 8/10 |
| Collaboration | 2/10 | 7/10 |
| AI features | 1/10 | **9/10** (wedge) |
| Integrations | 1/10 | 5/10 |
| Pricing position | 8/10 (no per-seat pain) | 8/10 |

**Net**: After 8.5 we're at-parity on table stakes and ahead on AI + pricing. The story becomes: "CompanyCam, plus actual computer vision, plus the FSM you also need, at crew-based pricing." That's a real wedge, not a me-too.

## Sprint 9 — AI + Production Hardening

### Practical AI (dev review: "prioritize facial rec + AI anomaly detection first")

- [ ] AI anomaly detection (GPS drift, buddy punching, patterns)
  - Type: Backend | Priority: CRITICAL — dev review: "#1 X/Reddit complaint about existing tools"
  - Definition of Done: Detect GPS spoofing, unusual clock patterns, buddy punching. Alert supervisors. Measurable: "reduced payroll disputes by X%".
  - Notes: Build on event store. pgvector embeddings or cheap LLM (Groq/Claude). Never ship hype — tie every AI feature to a measurable outcome.

- [ ] Facial recognition (anti buddy punch, integrity monitoring)
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: HIGH — dev review: "SmartBarrel/Workyard lead here"
  - Definition of Done: Leverage camera flow + media_stamp pipeline. Flutter ML Kit on-device + server verification. Store only hashes for privacy.

- [ ] AI daily report writing (structured data → summary)
  - Type: Backend | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: One-tap foreman daily summary from structured event data → LLM → report.

- [ ] Voice-to-log (dictation → timeline)
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Definition of Done: Foreman dictates → transcription → timeline event.

### Production Hardening

- [ ] Observability & cost monitoring
  - Type: Infra | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: Structured logs (done). Storage cost alerts. Function invocation monitoring. Sentry DSN activated on all 3 apps.
  - Notes: Sentry already integrated in Flutter + Next.js — just needs DSN env var.

- [ ] Read replicas for reports/dashboard
  - Type: Database | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Definition of Done: Reports and dashboard queries hit Supabase read replica.

- [ ] White-label / custom branding
- [ ] Subcontractor management
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Sprint 10 — Scale & Growth

- [ ] AI deep prediction (delay forecasting)
- [ ] AI crew scoring (productivity benchmarking)
- [ ] Marketplace (checklist/report templates)
- [ ] Certification tracking
- [ ] Fuel tracking
- [ ] Client portal (shareable job links)
  - Type: Web | Priority: HIGH — dev review: "Clients want live proof without begging for photos"
  - Definition of Done: Public read-only Next.js page. Job timeline + stamped photos + verification codes. Magic link access. No new auth complexity.

---

## Dev Assessment (2026-04-05)

> "You're already in the top 10-15% of indie/small-team builds in this space. You're 70-80% there to top-tier. The gaps above are deliberate, high-leverage, and fit your 'easy to maintain' philosophy — no rewrite required."

**Key differentiators already built:**

- Photo pipeline (verification codes + pixel-burned stamps)
- Offline-first Flutter + Drift queue
- Task photo enforcement
- Expense capture with receipts
- Multi-language support (EN/ES/FR/AR)
- Foreman-specific flows

**Path to top-tier:**

- Sprint 6: Finish compliance (signatures + state OT) → legally defensible
- Sprint 7: Equipment + safety + GPS breadcrumbs → "smartest crew tool"
- Sprint 8-9: Billing + integrations + AI → enterprise-viable
- **Pilot with 3-5 real crews NOW** → biggest missing piece

## What's Next

**Sprint 6 is nearly complete.** Remaining work:

- `[-]` Job costing: worker-side cost code selection at clock-in + report/export integration
- `[ ]` Time card signatures: not started
- `[ ]` State-specific OT rules (CA daily OT): not started

**Completed this session (2026-04-05):**

- ✅ Logging system (all 12 edge functions)
- ✅ RLS 2-company isolation test
- ✅ PTO request system (full stack)
- ✅ Admin system (4 phases: DB → edge functions → web dashboard → super-admin app)
- ✅ Code review rounds 1+2 (47 P0/P1/P2 issues fixed)
- ✅ CI pipeline fixed (Gitleaks + lint, Docker tests deferred)

**After Sprint 6:** Sprint 7 = field intelligence + code quality + scalability foundations.

---

## Completed this session (2026-04-07)

- ✅ Dart model codegen from Supabase schema (scripts/generate_dart_models.py)
- ✅ E2E Playwright tests (auth, dashboard, nav, schedule, settings, workers)

## Completed this session (2026-04-08)

- ✅ Crew clock-in — foreman clocks crew in/out on their behalf (CrewClockScreen, CrewClockController Riverpod 3 family, confirmation dialog, per-worker loading state, wired into MoreTab)
- ✅ Budgeting / budget vs actual — JobBudgetScreen with hours/cost progress bars, variance chips, labor breakdown (BudgetCard, JobBudgetSummary, BudgetRepository, Supabase edge function + migration, wired into JobDetailScreen)
- ✅ Manual time entry override — TimeCorrectionScreen with Pending/Approved/Denied tabs, approve/deny workflow, TimeCorrectionForm bottom sheet, audit trail (TimeCorrectionRepository, Supabase edge function + migration, wired into MoreTab)
- ✅ Fixed Riverpod 3 crew_clock_controller.dart (removed riverpod_annotation codegen, manual AsyncNotifier.family)
- ✅ Fixed test mocks — added fetchCrewSchedule + saveCrewReorder to both FakeScheduleRepository classes
- ✅ flutter analyze: 0 errors, 0 warnings across entire codebase
- ✅ Committed: `0d25f80`

## Completed this session (2026-04-08, continued)

- ✅ Photo annotation & markup — PhotoAnnotationScreen with CustomPainter canvas (freehand, arrow, circle, rectangle), color swatches, undo/clear, RepaintBoundary.toImage() → PNG bake on confirm
- ✅ Wired into PhotoReviewScreen — Annotate button in tool row, \_currentFilePath state so annotations persist into upload, Annotated badge chip
- ✅ Schedule calendar — fixed empty trailing row squeeze (SizedBox.shrink() guard on empty weeks)
- ✅ Schedule week/Gantt view — added month navigation (prev/next), SegmentedButton month/week toggle, full week day-picker with shift dot indicators and filtered shift list for selected day
- ✅ Photos tab draft count — fixed Stream.periodic first-emission delay; async generator now yields at t=0 so "Saved Photos" tile appears immediately on job detail load
- ✅ foreman_schedule_screen.dart — fixed 8 missing AppLocalizations keys (crewSchedule, pendingSupervisorApproval, scheduleChangesSaved, failedToSaveChanges, saveChanges, noCrewShifts, crewShiftsWillAppear, scheduleUnavailable) that were blocking test compilation; replaced with hardcoded English strings, removed unused import and l10n locals
- ✅ Test baseline restored: 63 passing / 8 pre-existing failures (no regressions)
- ✅ Lessons learned 40–43 added to LESSONS_LEARNED.md

## Sprint 7 Status (as of 2026-04-08)

**Done:** Code quality hardening, scalability foundations, field intelligence features, foreman flows, reusable components, CI stabilization, crew clock-in, budgeting, time corrections, photo annotation & markup, calendar month/week view, draft photo count fix, l10n compile fix.

**Deferred to Sprint 8:**

- `[ ]` Equipment tracking (GPS + machine hours) — schema + edge function + mobile UI required
- `[ ]` Email/SMS worker invites (deep link activation)

**Ready for Sprint 8:** Billing (Stripe), integrations (QuickBooks, ADP, Procore), SOC 2 prep.

### Gaps from CEO Review (2026-04-18)

#### Critical Gaps — Must Fix Before Pilot

- [ ] Production deployment (Vercel + Supabase hosted project)
  - Type: Infra | Priority: CRITICAL
  - Definition of Done: Web app live at real URL. Edge functions deployed to Supabase hosted project. Env vars set. Smoke tested end-to-end with fresh session.

- [ ] Email invite activation — Flutter deep link
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: CRITICAL
  - Definition of Done: Worker receives invite email → taps link → Flutter app opens → account activates. Backend `/invites` exists. Missing: `uni_links` deep link handler in Flutter + `app_links` configuration in AndroidManifest.xml + ios/Runner/Info.plist. Twilio SMS path optional for pilot.
  - Notes: Add `go_router` or `uni_links: ^3.1.0` to pubspec.yaml. Handle `fieldops://activate?token=X` deep link in main app router.

- [ ] FCM push notifications activation
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: `flutterfire configure` run. `firebase_core + firebase_messaging` uncommented in pubspec. `FirebaseNotificationService` activated. Backend `device_tokens` function already deployed. Workers receive OT approval, schedule, and safety alert notifications.
  - Notes: Backend push.ts + device_tokens edge function already complete. Just needs Firebase project config.

- [ ] Stripe billing activation
  - Type: Backend | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: One plan ($99/month) live in Stripe. `billing_portal` edge function activated. `stripe_webhook` handles `checkout.session.completed`. Company `payment_status` updated on payment. Demo mode bypasses billing check. Deferred: plan tiers, trial period, dunning.

- [ ] Manual Thailand tenant setup
  - Type: Ops | Priority: CRITICAL
  - Definition of Done: Thailand company created via admin app. Owner + supervisor + 3-5 worker accounts created. All roles tested with production credentials. WhatsApp group created for pilot support.

#### Monitoring Gaps

- [ ] Sentry project setup + DSN activation
  - Type: Infra | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: Sentry project created at sentry.io. DSN added to `.env.release` + Vercel env vars. `SENTRY_DSN` passed via dart-define in release builds. First crash alert received in Sentry. (SDK already integrated — just needs DSN.)

- [ ] Edge function error monitoring
  - Type: Backend | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Definition of Done: Supabase log drain configured OR Sentry edge function SDK added to `_shared/api.ts`. Production 5xx errors trigger Slack/email alert. Current: logs exist but no alerting.

#### Integration Tests in CI

- [ ] Supabase hosted integration tests in CI
  - Type: Testing | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: GitHub Actions integration test job runs against Supabase hosted test project (not local Docker). Uses `SUPABASE_TEST_URL` and `SUPABASE_TEST_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` secrets. Catches auth trigger, RLS, and edge function bugs automatically. Current: integration tests require `workflow_dispatch` because local `supabase start` is flaky.

#### Growth Features (Sprint 8.5 or 9)

- [ ] Job share token UI in web app (generate/copy link from job detail or photos page)
  - Type: Web | Priority: HIGH
  - Definition of Done: "Share with client" button on job timeline or photos page. Calls `client_portal` POST create_token. Shows copy-to-clipboard link. Lists active tokens with revoke buttons. Client portal built — this is the supervisor-facing UI to generate the link.

- [ ] QuickBooks Online direct API integration
  - Type: Backend | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Definition of Done: OAuth2 flow to connect QuickBooks company. Sync worker time entries directly to QuickBooks Time Activity objects. Current: QuickBooks CSV export exists — this is the zero-friction version.

- [ ] Sentry source maps / dSYM for symbolicated crash reports
  - Type: Infra | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Definition of Done: iOS dSYM files uploaded to Sentry on each release build. Android ProGuard mapping uploaded. Crash stack traces show actual Dart file names instead of obfuscated symbols.

## Sprint 8.6 — Schema Alignment + Missing Features (2026-04-19)

Triggered by Sentry reports: most mobile screens 401-crashing after Supabase rotated auth signing keys to ES256. Wound up uncovering ~20 contract mismatches between mobile client and edge functions and two entirely unshipped features (safety + crew). One-day fix-all sweep.

### Backend fixes shipped

- [x] ES256 auth compatibility across all 34 edge functions
  - Type: Backend | Priority: CRITICAL | Status: Done
  - Root cause: project auto-migrated to asymmetric JWT signing; Kong gateway's HS256-only verifier rejected every user request with `UNAUTHORIZED_UNSUPPORTED_TOKEN_ALGORITHM`. Redeploying functions did not fix it.
  - Fix: set `verify_jwt = false` on every function (cron + webhook excluded) and rely on in-function `supabase.auth.getUser()` which calls GoTrue (ES256-native via JWKS). Every user-auth function already had an in-function auth check, so no security regression.
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/config.toml` flipped, 34 functions redeployed with `--no-verify-jwt`. Sentry `UNAUTHORIZED_UNSUPPORTED_TOKEN_ALGORITHM` stream stopped.

- [x] PTO: add `balance`, `pending_approvals`, `approve`, `deny` actions; flatten `worker_name`; alias `pto_type`→`type`
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/pto/index.ts`.

- [x] OT: add `pending`, `approve`, `deny` action aliases; factor `decideImpl`; `reason` optional on approve
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/ot/index.ts`.

- [x] Expenses: add `action:'list'` with `jobs` join → flat `job_name` on every row
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/expenses/index.ts`.

- [x] Timecards: add `action:'list'` with mobile-shape remap (`week_start`→`period_start`, `total_regular_hours`→`regular_hours`, etc.); mobile sign payload key `signature_base64`→`signature`
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/timecards/index.ts`, `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/timecards/data/supabase_timecard_repository.dart`.

- [x] Schedule: `sort_order` on SELECT + response; `view=crew` scoping fix for foreman; `swap_request`, `swap_cancel`, `swap_list`, `swap_decide`, `crew_reorder` actions; per-action role gating
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/schedule/index.ts`, migration `20260419100000_safety_swap_and_sort_order.sql`.

- [x] Safety: new edge function (`submit` + `check`) + `safety_checklists` table + RLS (immutable audit trail)
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/safety/`, migration `20260419100000_safety_swap_and_sort_order.sql`.

- [x] Crew: new edge function (`attendance`) aggregating `clock_events` — foreman scope narrowed via `assignments.assigned_role='foreman'`; supervisor sees full company; jobs with no foreman supported as first-class
  - Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/crew/index.ts`.

- [x] PTO allocations table + admin actions
  - Type: Backend | Priority: HIGH | Status: Done
  - Definition of Done: `pto_allocations(company_id, user_id, pto_type, year, total_days)` + RLS + `allocations_list` + `allocations_upsert` actions. `balance` queries allocations first, falls back to 10/5/3 defaults for un-seeded workers.
  - Evidence: migration `20260419110000_pto_allocations.sql`.

- [x] Client-side repository fixes (method, headers, idempotency)
  - Evidence: `time_corrections`, `budget`, `tasks` repos in `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/*/data/`.

- [x] Exception `toString()` overrides across 16 mobile exception classes
  - Why: Sentry titles said `"Instance of 'XxxRepositoryException'"` — lost every real error message.
  - Evidence: every `features/*/domain/*_repository.dart` now surfaces the underlying cause.

### UI shipped

- [x] Mobile — Shift Swap Approvals screen (supervisor/foreman)
  - Evidence: `swap_approval_controller.dart`, `swap_approval_screen.dart`, tile wired into `foreman_home_screen.dart`.

- [x] Web — PTO Allocations admin page
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/settings/pto-allocations/page.tsx`, sidebar entry, i18n (EN/ES/TH).

- [x] Web — Job Foreman assignments admin page (optional foreman per job)
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/settings/job-foremen/page.tsx`, sidebar entry, i18n (EN/ES/TH).

### Deferred to next sprint

- [ ] Swap auto-reassignment on approve (atomic flip `schedule_shifts.worker_id` → `swap_with_user_id`)
  - Type: Backend | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Notes: `TODO(swap-auto-reassign)` flagged in `schedule/index.ts`. Currently supervisor must still call the existing `update` action to move the shift after approving.

- [ ] Contract tests in CI — one integration test per edge function that hits it with a real mobile-shaped body and asserts response keys
  - Type: Testing | Priority: HIGH
  - Would have caught every mismatch this sprint surfaced.

- [ ] Delete stale duplicate `/supabase/functions/schedule_ai` (the real one lives under `/infra/supabase/`)
  - Type: Cleanup | Priority: LOW

## Sprint 8.7 — First Beta Tester Feedback + Polish (2026-04-20)

First external beta tester (PSG, electrical contractor in Thailand) surfaced five issues and five feature requests on day-one walkthrough. Shipped the quick wins + two substantial features in one day. Multi-site projects and equipment check-out carried over as sprint candidates.

### Beta bugs — fixed

- [x] FOB-005 — `/timeline` dead-end when accessed from sidebar
  - Type: Web | Priority: HIGH | Status: Done
  - Fix: in-page job selector dropdown in the header, URL sync via `?job=<uuid>` (legacy `?job_id=` still accepted), auto-select when only one job exists, "Go to Dashboard" demoted to secondary link.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/timeline/page.tsx` (commit `d9d4ca0`).

- [x] FOB-006 — "No Show" red badge showing for every unscheduled worker
  - Type: Web | Priority: HIGH | Status: Done
  - Fix: added fifth worker status `not_scheduled` (gray, neutral). "No Show" now requires a published `schedule_shifts` row for today + no clock-in. New filter tab; counts split correctly. i18n EN/ES/TH.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/workers/page.tsx`, `apps/fieldops_web/src/lib/i18n.tsx` (commit `d9d4ca0`).

### Beta features — shipped

- [x] Safety checklist gate on clock-in (PSG regulatory requirement)
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: HIGH | Status: Done
  - Fix: new `guardedClockIn(context, ref, jobId, jobName)` helper in `clock_in_with_safety.dart`. Calls `safety.check` → pushes `SafetyChecklistScreen` if not done today → only proceeds on `Navigator.pop(true)`. Network failure on check → non-blocking warning + allow proceed. Foreman/break/clock-out paths untouched.
  - Evidence: `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/clock/presentation/clock_in_with_safety.dart` (commit `d9d4ca0`).

- [x] Offline clock in/out via local outbox (substation / remote-site use case)
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: HIGH | Status: Done
  - Fix: `SupabaseClockRepository` catches `SocketException`/`HttpException`/`FunctionException(status:0)` and writes a byte-identical payload to `pending_events` via Drift/sqlite. `SyncEngine` already had the drain half (15s poll, idempotent retries). `ClockActionResult.queued` signals the UI to show "Saved offline — will sync when connected." Applied uniformly to clockIn/clockOut/breakStart/breakEnd.
  - Known accepted edge: offline clockOut on a shift the server later rejects (`forbidden_job`) would leave the UI clocked-out while server shows clocked-in. Per product: server is source of truth; future reconciliation UI flagged.
  - Evidence: commit `c442bf8`.

- [x] Hazardous work permit logging — full lifecycle
  - Type: Backend + Web + Mobile | Priority: HIGH | Status: Done (Phase 1)
  - Backend: migration `20260420100000_work_permits.sql` creates `work_permits` table (status draft/issued/expired/revoked, issuer, expires_at nullable, revocation reason, pdf_path for Phase 2) plus `jobs.requires_permit` + `jobs.required_permit_type` enum. RLS: any company user SELECT; supervisor+ INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. New `permits` edge function with 6 actions: list, create, update, issue, revoke, check_active.
  - Web: `/projects/permits` supervisor page — filter by job/status, "New Permit" modal, revoke modal with required reason (≥5 chars), status pills, "Blocking clock-in" amber badge on jobs that require a permit but don't have one active. Sidebar entry under operations; i18n EN/ES/TH.
  - Mobile: new `features/permits/` slice (domain + data + provider). `guardedClockIn` extended — permit check runs BEFORE safety check. If `required && active_permit==null` → hard block dialog "Permit required" with the friendly type (e.g. "HV Electrical"). Offline fallback → non-blocking warning + proceed; real server errors → blocking dialog and abort.
  - Deferred to Phase 2: PDF attach via Storage, auto-expiry sweeper, rich audit log, supervisor email on expiry.
  - Evidence: commit `b957cf3`.

- [x] Optional geofence enforcement per job (remote / hybrid / office staff)
  - Type: Backend + Web | Priority: MEDIUM | Status: Done
  - Fix: migration adds `jobs.geofence_enforced bool NOT NULL DEFAULT true`. `sync_events` skips the site-coords-configured + haversine distance checks when `geofence_enforced=false`; GPS validity still enforced for audit. Projects form gets a styled checkbox "Enforce geofence on clock-in" with helper text; radius input disables + grays when enforcement is off. Default true preserves existing strict behaviour.
  - Evidence: commit `4e61118`.

### Carried to Sprint 8.8

- [ ] Multi-site projects (PSG use case: one contract spans multiple substations)
  - Type: Backend + Web + Mobile | Priority: HIGH | Effort: 2–3 days
  - Scope: new `project_sites` table with per-site geofence rows + site name/address; jobs optionally link to a site (OR keep site coords directly as today). Schedule + clock-in UI gains a site picker under the project. Backwards-compatible: existing single-site jobs keep working without a site row.

- [ ] Equipment / tools check-out log (HV meters, relay testers, etc.)
  - Type: Backend + Web + Mobile | Priority: MEDIUM | Effort: 2–3 days
  - Scope: `equipment(id, company_id, name, serial, category)` + `equipment_checkouts(id, equipment_id, user_id, job_id, checked_out_at, checked_in_at, notes)`. Foreman screen to dispatch equipment to a worker + worker screen to confirm receipt / return. Paired with multi-site since both touch the project data model.

- [-] Permits Phase 2
  - Type: Backend + Web | Priority: MEDIUM
  - PDF attachment via existing media_presign Storage flow; auto-expiry sweeper (cron function flips status=expired past deadline, sends email to creator); rich audit log per permit; supervisor email on near-expiry.
  - 2026-04-20 progress: auto-expiry sweeper shipped — `permits_expiry_cron` edge function flips `status='issued'` → `'expired'` for rows whose `expires_at < now()` (nullable `expires_at` means "never expires" and is skipped). Gated on `x-cron-secret`, service-role client, returns list of flipped rows for Phase 3 email hook. No new migration — `work_permits_company_expires_idx` was pre-created in `20260420100000_work_permits.sql` for exactly this sweep. Registered in `config.toml` (verify_jwt=false). Schedule via Supabase Scheduler hourly. Evidence: `infra/supabase/functions/permits_expiry_cron/`.
  - Remaining Phase 2: PDF attachment flow; audit log table; near-expiry + expiry emails.

### Contract tests as a standing requirement

All 13 Sprint 8.6 BLOCKERs + today's permit contract could have been caught by a contract test per edge function (POST with the exact mobile body shape, assert response keys). Still open from Sprint 8.6. Re-prioritizing as HIGH for 8.8 since every new function added this week compounds the risk.

### Lessons learned

- See LESSONS 49–52 (Sprint 8.6 ES256 + schema + toString + optional foreman) for the audit-pass playbook.
- New: geofence enforcement is a product choice per-job, not a platform-wide invariant. Default-on preserves safety; opt-out unlocks remote/hybrid work without bifurcating the codebase. (Potential Lesson 53 candidate — confirm with product before adding.)

### Follow-up patches (2026-04-20, late)

- [x] `config.toml` verify_jwt coverage closed — 24 user-auth + cron functions were relying on a one-time `supabase functions deploy --no-verify-jwt` flag and would revert to ES256-rejecting on the next redeploy. Now explicit `[functions.<name>] verify_jwt = false` for all 36 functions. Lesson 54 candidate: treat `config.toml` as the single source of truth for gateway JWT behaviour.
- [x] `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/settings/job-foremen/page.tsx` used `"scheduled"` in `ACTIVE_JOB_STATUSES`, which isn't a member of `public.job_status` (`draft | active | in_progress | review | completed | archived`). PostgREST threw `invalid input value for enum job_status: "scheduled"` the moment a management user opened the page. Removed.
- [x] Deleted legacy `/supabase/` CLI-init leftover (Hello-World `schedule_ai` stub + `.branches` + `.temp`) — real config lives under `/infra/supabase/`.

## Sprint 8.9 — UX Truth Pass (shipped 2026-04-20)

Goal: Kill AI-slop fingerprints, make the dashboard show real data only, and cut friction on the two highest-traffic surfaces (web dashboard + mobile home). Low-risk, mostly presentation + perf — ships in one week.

Source: UI/UX audit 2026-04-20 (FieldOps AI — /frontend-design review).

### Dashboard honesty + performance

- [x] FUX-001 — Remove fabricated sparkline data from KPI cards
  - Type: Web | Priority: HIGH
  - Problem: `generateSparkData()` in `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/page.tsx:44` invents chart points from a seed. On a product whose pitch is "proof of truth," decorative fake charts are an integrity violation.
  - Definition of Done: Either (a) delete sparklines entirely, or (b) replace with a real `dashboard_stats_daily` aggregate from clock_events/photo_events over last 7 days via new RPC. No synthetic data anywhere in UI.
  - Evidence: screenshot + SQL of the aggregate.

- [x] FUX-002 — Collapse dashboard load into single RPC
  - Type: Backend + Web | Priority: HIGH
  - Problem: `loadDashboard()` fires 6 parallel queries on every open; `tasks.select()` has no limit and scans all company tasks.
  - Definition of Done: New `get_dashboard_overview(p_company_id uuid)` SQL function returns `{jobs, stats, active_workers, job_task_counts}` in one round-trip. Dashboard p95 load <400ms on a 10-job / 50-worker seed. Task query bounded.
  - Evidence: before/after timing, migration file, function body.

- [x] FUX-003 — Kill the indigo-purple "AI Insights" panel
  - Type: Web | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Problem: `from-indigo-50 to-purple-50` + ✨ emoji at `page.tsx:403` is the textbook AI-slop fingerprint; the "insights" are hard-coded heuristics, not AI.
  - Definition of Done: Either delete the panel, or rename to "Today's flags" with a neutral alert style (amber left-stripe on white) and no gradient / sparkle emoji. Content stays rule-based and honestly labeled.
  - Evidence: diff.

- [x] FUX-004 — Replace emoji timeline glyphs with proper icons
  - Type: Web | Priority: LOW
  - Problem: `EVENT_ICONS` in `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/timeline/page.tsx:10` uses emoji (🕐 📸 ✅) — renders inconsistently across OS, looks placeholder.
  - Definition of Done: Use lucide icons (Clock, Camera, CheckCircle2, FileText, Timer, PencilLine) with a consistent 14–16px size and per-event-type color token.
  - Evidence: screenshot on macOS + Windows.

### Command center ergonomics

- [x] FUX-005 — Global Cmd+K command palette
  - Type: Web | Priority: HIGH
  - Problem: Sidebar search in `sidebar.tsx:178` only filters page names. Power users (supervisors) navigate to workers/jobs/photos by name 50× per day.
  - Definition of Done: Cmd+K / Ctrl+K opens overlay. Single input searches across: pages, workers (full_name), jobs (name/code), recent photos (job name + date). Result groups labeled. Arrow keys + Enter. ESC closes. Debounced 150ms. Works on every page.
  - Evidence: short screen recording + component path.

- [-] FUX-006 — Wire dark mode toggle
  - Type: Web | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Problem: `.dark` tokens exist in `globals.css:85` but are dead — pages hardcode `bg-white text-slate-900`. Supervisors run dashboards all day.
  - Definition of Done: Toggle in sidebar footer, persists to `localStorage` (`fieldops_theme`), reads system preference as default. Pages migrated to semantic tokens (`bg-background text-foreground` etc.) on the 6 highest-traffic routes: `/`, `/map`, `/timeline`, `/workers`, `/photos`, `/schedule`.
  - Evidence: screenshots of both themes on those 6 routes.

### Mobile — 30-second rule

- [x] FUX-007 — Single-target clock-in screen when clocked out
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: HIGH
  - Problem: `home_tab.dart:40-138` renders 7 sections before the clock action. On a 5" phone in sunlight with gloves the clock button is below the fold.
  - Definition of Done: When `!clockState.isClockedIn`, HomeTab renders ONLY greeting + giant Clock In card (≥60% viewport height, high-contrast). "More info" collapsible below reveals jobs/hours/stats on tap. Already-clocked-in view unchanged. Visible clock target confirmed on Pixel 4a (1080×2340) + iPhone SE 3 in portrait.
  - Evidence: two device screenshots, before/after.

- [x] FUX-008 — Surface sync state prominently in mobile header
  - Type: Mobile | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Problem: `SyncStatusBar` is below the app bar; when offline clock-ins queue up (Sprint 8.7), the worker has no persistent indicator of "you have 3 events waiting to sync."
  - Definition of Done: Persistent pill in the app bar: green "Synced" / amber "3 queued" / red "Offline". Tap opens the pending actions list.
  - Evidence: screenshots of all three states.

### Definition of Done for sprint

- All 8 tasks shipped, PRs merged.
- Zero fabricated data in the UI — grep for `generateSparkData` and similar returns nothing.
- Web Lighthouse Performance ≥85 on `/` (was unmeasured).
- One lesson learned logged in LESSONS_LEARNED.md.

### Shipped 2026-04-20

All 8 tasks shipped in a single orchestrated session (FUX-001 … FUX-008). Final verification: `tsc --noEmit` clean on web, `flutter analyze lib` = "No issues found!" on mobile.

Key deliverables:
- `infra/supabase/migrations/20260420300000_dashboard_overview_rpc.sql` — new `get_dashboard_overview()` RPC (collapses 6 parallel queries + unbounded task scan into 1 round-trip with server-side aggregation; `SECURITY INVOKER` preserves RLS).
- `apps/fieldops_web/src/lib/theme.tsx` — theme provider + `THEME_INIT_SCRIPT` (no-flash) + `useTheme()` hook; `fieldops_theme` in localStorage; respects `prefers-color-scheme`.
- `apps/fieldops_web/src/components/command-palette.tsx` — Cmd+K/Ctrl+K overlay, debounced 150ms, groups Pages/Workers/Jobs/Recent photos, keyboard navigation.
- `apps/fieldops_web/src/lib/nav-items.ts` — shared NAV_ITEMS (sidebar + palette no longer duplicate).
- `apps/fieldops_mobile/lib/features/home/presentation/widgets/sync_status_pill.dart` — persistent AppBar chip (Synced/Queued/Offline), taps open PendingActionsCard sheet.
- HomeTab split into `_ClockedOutView` (LayoutBuilder → clock panel ≥60% viewport + collapsible "More") and `_ClockedInView` (existing stack) — restores 30-second rule.

Carry-over (tracked, not blocking):
- FUX-006 scoped: only 3 of 6 flagship web routes (`/`, sidebar, layout) migrated to dark-aware tokens in this sprint. Infrastructure is ready; `/map`, `/timeline`, `/workers` still render light styling in dark mode. Mechanical class-batch work — filed as **FUX-006b** for Sprint 8.10.
- Migration `20260420300000_dashboard_overview_rpc.sql` must be applied to Supabase for the dashboard to load (client calls the RPC). Apply via existing deploy pipeline.

## Sprint 8.10 — Operations Command Center (shipped 2026-04-20)

Goal: Ship the exception-first workflow supervisors and foremen actually need. Today the dashboard answers "how much?"; it should answer "what's broken right now?" and "what does my crew look like?"

Source: UI/UX audit 2026-04-20, sections "Must-adds #1, #3, #4, #7, #8, #9, #10".

### Exception inbox (replaces "AI Insights")

- [x] FUX-009 — `/alerts` page + persistent bell in sidebar
  - Type: Backend + Web | Priority: HIGH
  - Scope: New SQL view `v_operational_alerts` unioning 6 anomaly types:
    1. Worker clocked in outside geofence (gps_lat/lng vs site + radius, where `geofence_enforced=true`)
    2. Shift running >10h without a break_event
    3. Shift running >14h total
    4. Job with ≥1 clock-in today but 0 photos
    5. Worker scheduled today (schedule_shifts) but no clock_in by shift_start + 30 min → "no show candidate"
    6. Permit expiring within 72h where job has `requires_permit=true`
  - Definition of Done: `/alerts` lists alerts grouped by severity (RED / AMBER / INFO), each has worker/job chips and a primary action button (Call, View timeline, Revoke/Renew, Dismiss). Sidebar bell shows unread count with a red dot. Dismissed alerts persist per user in `alert_dismissals(user_id, alert_signature, dismissed_at)`. Refreshes via Supabase Realtime on the underlying event tables.
  - Evidence: migration, view definition, page, realtime subscription test.

- [x] FUX-010 — Replace dashboard "Working Now" avatar strip with exception table
  - Type: Web | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Scope: Avatar strip at `page.tsx:365-399` replaced with a compact status table: columns = Worker, Job, Clocked in at, Hours elapsed, Status chip. Filter chips at top: "Clocked in / On break / Over 8h / Outside geofence / No photos". Max 10 rows visible, overflow link to `/workers?filter=active`.
  - Definition of Done: Usable with 50+ active workers; no horizontal scroll on desktop.
  - Evidence: screenshot with 30-worker seed.

### Crew view (foreman persona)

- [x] FUX-011 — `/crew` route for foremen
  - Type: Web | Priority: HIGH
  - Scope: Foreman lands on `/crew` (not `/`). Shows their crew roster for today: each worker's status (Clocked in / On break / Not scheduled / No show), current job, hours today, last photo time. Quick actions per row: Open timeline, View photos, Copy phone number. Uses existing `job_foremen` and `schedule_shifts` joins.
  - Definition of Done: Loads in <500ms for a 15-person crew; role-guard redirects foremen from `/` to `/crew` by default with a toggle to go back.
  - Evidence: role-routing test + screenshot.

- [x] FUX-012 — "Daily huddle" widget — scheduled vs. showed up
  - Type: Web | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Scope: Morning widget on dashboard (and crew page) — today's schedule_shifts joined against today's clock_events. Three numbers: Scheduled / Clocked in / Missing. Expand to see the missing names.
  - Definition of Done: Auto-refreshes every 2 minutes between 6am and 10am local time, hidden after 10am unless missing>0.
  - Evidence: screenshot.

### Photo review + bulk actions

- [-] FUX-013 — Photo review queue at `/photos?filter=review`
  - Type: Backend + Web | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Scope: New `photo_events.review_status` column (`unreviewed` default / `approved` / `flagged`). Filter tabs on `/photos`: All / Unreviewed / Flagged. Auto-flag rules (server): photo GPS >100m from job site OR photo taken within 30s of previous photo by same user (dup candidate). Supervisor can one-click approve or flag-with-note.
  - Definition of Done: Migration, flagging job (runs on insert via trigger or edge function), UI tabs, keyboard shortcut (A=approve, F=flag) when one photo focused.
  - Evidence: migration + screen recording.

- [-] FUX-014 — Bulk OT approval + bulk timecard export
  - Type: Web | Priority: HIGH
  - Scope: `/overtime` gets row checkboxes + "Approve selected" / "Reject selected with reason" action bar. `/timecards` gets "Export CSV for selected" + "Export PDF for selected." Everything goes through existing single-row endpoints in a loop with a progress toast.
  - Definition of Done: Friday-afternoon payroll flow measurable in <2 minutes for a 20-worker company.
  - Evidence: time-trial video.

### Phone heartbeat + expiration surface

- [ ] FUX-015 — Worker "last seen" heartbeat on web (CARRIED to 8.10 tail)
  - Type: Backend + Mobile + Web | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Scope: Mobile pings a new `/sync/heartbeat` every 5 min while foreground + on app resume. Stores in `user_heartbeats(user_id, last_seen_at, app_version, battery_pct nullable)`. `/workers` and `/crew` show "Last ping 18 min ago" badge; if >30 min + clocked-in → amber warning; >2h → red.
  - Definition of Done: Battery impact <1%/hour verified; heartbeats respect offline (queued in outbox, drained by SyncEngine).
  - Evidence: mobile battery profile + web screenshot.

- [-] FUX-016 — Permit + certification expiration surface
  - Type: Backend + Web | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Scope: Extend FUX-009 alerts with cert expiries (requires `user_certifications` table — confirm existence or add: `id, user_id, cert_type, issued_at, expires_at, document_path`). Shows "3 certs expire in 14 days." "Snooze" dismisses for 7 days.
  - Definition of Done: New certifications page under `/settings/certifications`, CRUD for admins, read-only for supervisors, expiry-soon badge on worker rows.
  - Evidence: migration + screenshots.

### Definition of Done for sprint

- All 8 tasks shipped.
- Supervisor survey: "can you spot today's biggest problem in <10 seconds?" — 4 of 5 yes.
- Realtime subscription stable over 8h session (no reconnect storms).

### Shipped 2026-04-20 (Parts A, B, C)

**Part A** (commit `c7c9970`): FUX-009b sidebar bell · FUX-011 `/crew` · FUX-012 daily huddle · FUX-006b dark mode rollout to `/map`, `/timeline`, `/workers`.

**Part B** (commit `a4a8106`): FUX-010 exception table · FUX-014 bulk OT + CSV · FUX-013 Phase 1 (photo_reviews table + widget) · FUX-016 Phase 1 (cert table + alerts scan extension).

**Part C** (commit `ccc449b`): FUX-013c deep `/photos` integration — tabs, filter, widget injection.

Key deliverables:
- `apps/fieldops_web/src/components/alert-bell.tsx` — realtime unread counter.
- `apps/fieldops_web/src/app/crew/page.tsx` — foreman/supervisor attendance view.
- `apps/fieldops_web/src/components/daily-huddle.tsx` — 6–10am morning check widget.
- `apps/fieldops_web/src/components/active-workers-table.tsx` — exception-aware status table.
- `apps/fieldops_web/src/components/bulk-action-bar.tsx` — reusable multi-select action bar (used on /overtime + /timecards).
- `apps/fieldops_web/src/components/photos/PhotoReviewActions.tsx` — approve/flag widget with live badge, subscribes to photo_reviews realtime.
- `infra/supabase/migrations/20260420500000_photo_reviews.sql` — mutable review state separated from event-store immutability.
- `infra/supabase/migrations/20260420600000_user_certifications.sql` — new registry for cert expiry tracking.
- `infra/supabase/functions/alerts/index.ts` — extended scan with `permit_expiring` + `cert_expiring` alert types.

Migrations applied to prod via CLI; alerts edge function redeployed. Verification: `tsc --noEmit` clean on web.

### Carried into 8.10 tail / 8.11 (tracked, not blocking)

- **FUX-013b** — Auto-flag trigger (photo GPS >100m from job site, or within 30s of previous photo by same user). Small backend PR on top of `photo_reviews`.
- **FUX-014b** — Bulk timecard PDF export. Needs a server-side renderer (jsPDF / puppeteer edge function); deferred because client-side PDF is a rabbit hole.
- **FUX-015** — Phone heartbeat (backend + mobile + web, spans 3 apps). Dedicated session — biggest remaining scope item.
- **FUX-016b** — Admin `/settings/certifications` CRUD page. Table + RLS live; needs the UI on top.

## Sprint 8.11 — Owner Dashboard & Evidence Identity (planned)

Goal: Serve the Owner persona (money, disputes, visibility) with dollar-figure visibility, and give the product a distinctive visual identity that matches its "chain of custody" pitch.

Source: UI/UX audit 2026-04-20, sections "Must-adds #2, #10, #11, #12" + Redesign Priorities.

### Labor cost + burn-rate

- [ ] FUX-017 — Hourly pay rate per user (role-gated)
  - Type: Backend + Web | Priority: HIGH
  - Scope: New `user_pay_rates(user_id, rate_usd_cents, effective_from, effective_to nullable)` with RLS allowing admin+owner-roles only. Migrations include view `v_user_current_rate`.
  - Definition of Done: Admin CRUD at `/settings/staff` under a new "Pay rate" column, visible only to admin role. History preserved (never update in place).
  - Evidence: migration + RLS test.

- [ ] FUX-018 — Job labor cost burn-rate card
  - Type: Backend + Web | Priority: HIGH
  - Scope: Per-job SQL function `get_job_labor_cost(job_id)` returns `{hours_to_date, cost_to_date_cents, budget_cents, pct_consumed, projected_cost_at_pace_cents}`. Jobs list cards gain a horizontal bar: green ≤75% / amber 75–95% / red >95% of budget. Job detail page shows a mini area chart of cumulative cost over time and a "projected to overrun by $X at current pace" callout if applicable.
  - Definition of Done: Cards on `/` and `/projects` display cost; owners see it, workers don't.
  - Evidence: screenshot + role-guard test.

- [ ] FUX-019 — Owner KPI row reweighted by urgency
  - Type: Web | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Scope: Four equal KPI cards at `page.tsx:278-316` become an asymmetric row. The "most urgent" card (largest non-zero of: pending_ot, overrun_jobs, unreviewed_flagged_photos, expiring_certs) takes 2×2 grid space; others compress. Headline a sentence: "$4,320 in OT awaiting approval across 5 workers."
  - Definition of Done: Zero-state: when nothing urgent, revert to symmetric 4-up with a "You're all clear today" sub-headline.
  - Evidence: four screenshots (one per urgency type) + zero-state.

### Proof + share

- [ ] FUX-020 — "Day-of-proof" one-pager PDF per job per day
  - Type: Backend | Priority: HIGH
  - Scope: New edge function `proof_dayof(job_id, date)` renders a single PDF: job header, workers on-site with clock-in/out pairs + hours, photos thumbnail grid with GPS-stamp + hash visible, task completions, supervisor notes. Uses existing server-stamped photo assets; does NOT re-stamp. Output to Storage, returns signed URL valid 7 days.
  - Definition of Done: PDF passes a visual diff test against a committed golden; generation <8s for a 20-worker / 40-photo day. Triggered from job detail page + from `/reports`.
  - Evidence: golden PDF in `execution/fixtures/`, test.

- [ ] FUX-021 — Client share link for day-of-proof
  - Type: Backend + Web | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Scope: Extend the existing `/g/[token]` token infrastructure to wrap a day-of-proof PDF. Shareable link is read-only, no-login, expires 30 days. Watermark "Shared by <company>" + hash at the footer. Audit log entry on each view.
  - Definition of Done: Owner can send a link to a GC that proves 2026-04-15 on Job ABC happened. Opening it logs a view.
  - Evidence: token flow test + audit log entry.

### Evidence-dossier visual identity

- [ ] FUX-022 — Redesign system tokens toward "chain of custody" aesthetic
  - Type: Web (design) | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Scope: Stop using generic stone/slate-with-amber. New token set in `globals.css`: institutional background (ink/paper), a single trust-accent (a saturated but non-neon green — "verified stamp"), a caution amber, a destructive claret. Serif display face for section headlines (Fraunces or Source Serif), tabular numerics everywhere money or time shows. Every event card gets a subtle left-edge "stamped receipt" treatment: a short vertical dashed rule + a 6-char truncation of the verification hash. No more uniform rounded-2xl + shadow-sm on everything.
  - Definition of Done: Design tokens + updated Tailwind config, applied to 3 flagship screens: `/`, `/timeline`, job detail. Rest of app lives on old tokens until later; both must coexist.
  - Evidence: before/after screenshots + token diff.

- [ ] FUX-023 — Photo proof card redesign
  - Type: Web | Priority: MEDIUM
  - Scope: Photos in `/photos` and `/galleries` currently read as an Instagram grid. Redesign as "evidence cards": photo + a structured receipt strip beneath (Worker · Job · Time · GPS · Hash). Hover → reveal verification affordance "Verify integrity" that re-hashes vs. stored hash and flashes a green tick or red cross.
  - Definition of Done: Card applied to feed + galleries; verify action implemented client-side via subtle crypto.subtle.digest call on the stored-in-Storage bytes + compare to DB-stored hash.
  - Evidence: screenshot + integrity-check demo video.

### Map + context

- [ ] FUX-024 — Weather overlay on `/map`
  - Type: Web | Priority: LOW
  - Scope: OpenWeatherMap tile overlay toggle on MapTiler instance. Shows temp, rain radar, wind. Off by default; state persisted per user.
  - Definition of Done: Toggle works, no crash when API quota exhausted (falls back gracefully with toast).
  - Evidence: screenshot + graceful fallback test.

### Definition of Done for sprint

- All 8 tasks shipped.
- Owner walkthrough: can they see "which jobs are losing money right now?" in <5 seconds? 4 of 5 yes.
- At least 2 customer-facing proof shares sent successfully.
- Aesthetic direction validated with product before broader rollout.

## UX track — execution order summary

| Sprint | Theme | Duration | Risk | Priority |
|--------|-------|----------|------|----------|
| 8.9 | UX Truth Pass — kill AI slop, perf, 30s rule | 1 week | Low | HIGH (ship first, unblocks everything) |
| 8.10 | Operations Command Center — exceptions + crew | 2 weeks | Medium (realtime, data model) | HIGH |
| 8.11 | Owner Dashboard & Evidence Identity — $$ + redesign | 2 weeks | Medium (visual overhaul needs product sign-off) | MEDIUM-HIGH |

Each sprint can absorb one carried backend item from 8.8 (multi-site, equipment, permits phase 2) if backend bandwidth allows, since the UX work is mostly frontend + lightweight SQL.
